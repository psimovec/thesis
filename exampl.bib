	that transforms transition-based generalized B{\"u}chi
	automata (TGBAs) into equivalent semi-deterministic
	automata. The tool has been extended with numerous
	optimizations and produces considerably smaller automata
	than its first version. In connection with the
	state-of-the-art LTL to TGBAs translator Spot, Seminator~2
	produces smaller (on average) semi-deterministic automata
	than the direct LTL to semi-deterministic automata
	translator \texttt{ltl2ldgba} of the Owl library. Further,
	Seminator~2 has been extended with an improved NCSB
	complementation procedure for semi-deterministic automata,
	providing a new way to complement automata that is
	competitive with state-of-the-art complementation tools.},

New automata-manipulation tools were introduced in Spot 2.0; they support arbitrary acceptance conditions, as expressible in the Hanoi Omega Automaton format. Besides being useful to researchers who have automata to process, its Python bindings can also be used in interactive environments to teach $\omega$-automata and model checking.",
